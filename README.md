# Travel Analysis Project 2023

Welcome to the Travel Analysis Project 2023 repository! This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing travel data for a Mexican company. The project includes an interactive web application that displays various insights and visualizations related to travel expenses, destinations, and more.

## Project Structure

The project repository contains the following key files and directories:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the web application, containing the structure and layout of the pages.

- **static/css/style2.css**: CSS file responsible for styling the web application, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

- **static/js/logic.js**: JavaScript file containing the logic for updating and interacting with the visualizations on the web page.

- **static/js/data.json**: JSON file containing travel data for analysis.

- **static/js/location_data.json**: JSON file containing location data used for creating a map visualization.

- **static/js/time_data.json**: JSON file containing time-series data for creating a time chart.

- **pandas/jupyter.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file where the original data is processed and transformed into the JSON files used by the web application.

- **pandas/viajes.csv**: CSV file containing the original travel data.

- **img/**: Directory containing marker icons used in the map visualization.

## Web Application

The web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes various libraries and dependencies for enhanced functionality:

- **Leaflet**: Used for creating an interactive map.
